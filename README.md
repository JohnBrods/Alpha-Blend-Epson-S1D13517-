This Epson S1D13517 “hardware Alpha-Blend” C file is a much improved version over the initial v1 back in 2022.
This version2 includes the proper standard for SD card initialisation including reading voltage levels and whether the SD card is SDHC or just HDSC.
It will initialise SDHC cards, though this current Alpha-Blend function only required SDSC and FAT16.
